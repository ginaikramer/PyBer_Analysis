# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize PyBer ride share data to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Specifically, this project:
- Summarizes ride-sharing data by three different city types: urban, suburban and rural
- Calculates and visualizes the total weekly fares for each city type
- Summarizes how the data differs by city type
- Provides recommendations based on these differences

The following file was used in building this report: [PyBer Data Analysis](/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb) 

## Results
PyBer ride share data consists of three different city types: urban, suburban and rural. Let's see how the data differed between these three city types.

## Summary
Based on the results from this analysis, I'd like to provide the following three recommendations to address disparities among the city types.
